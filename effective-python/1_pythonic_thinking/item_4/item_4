Write helper funcitons instead of complex expressions

Pythonâ€™s syntax makes it all too easy to write single-line expressions that are overly
complicated and difficult to read.

Move complex expressions into helper functions, especially if you need to use the
same logic repeatedly.

The if/else expression provides a more readable alternative to using Boolean
operators like or and and in expressions

An example of this is when you are trying to parse something from a string.
If you know that what you are looking for might be of type int, or string or 
even it might not even exist, then instead of creating a humongous one-liner
that no-one ever is going to understand(even you after a week or so) consider
using a helper function with a descriptive name which does everything clearly 
in the body of the function and returns the result

This way you can reuse most part of your code, it will be clean, clear and
not discusting!
