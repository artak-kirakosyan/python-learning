Item 10 prefer enumerate over range

Built-in range function allows to iterate over a set of integers

Usually we need to iterate over a list of strings or something else.
We can do so directly using for something in smth_list, but this gives us only elements.

Often we want to iterate over elements but also know the index.
One workaround is to use range(len(list)) and then access things inside the for loop, but there is a better way to do this:

for ind, smth in enumerate(smth_list)

You can also specify the starting index:
for ind, smth in enumerate(smth_list, 1):

this will generate indexes starting at 1 not at 0.

Things to remember:
1. enumerate provides concise syntax for looping over an iterator while also
    having the index
2. prefer enumerate instead of looping over a range and indexing
3. we can supply second argument to enumerate to specify a number from which to begin counting(default is 0)
