Prefer exceptions to returning None

When writing funcitons, we usually might think that returning None for some 
problematic cases is a good choice.
The problem with that is we might misinterpret results:
Here is an example:

def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b;
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return None


Here is how we would use it:
result = divide(x/y)
if result is None:
    print("Invalid inputs")

This would work fine but what is we do the chek like this:

x, y = 0, 5
result = divide(x, y)
if not result:
    print("invalid inputs")

this is not correct as the result is 0, and the condition will evaluate to true.
and print out "invalid inputs" message.

One workaround is to return 2 values from the function: first is the success
and the second one is the result

def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return True, a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return False, None


and use it as follows:
success, result = divide(x, y)
if not success:
    print("invalid inpts")

The problem with this solution is that the caller might ignore the first argument:
_, result = divide(x, y)
if not result:
    print("Invalid inputs")

now we are back to the same issue: result might be zero, but we will assume we had
invalid inputs

the second better way to do this is as follows:
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        raise ValueError("invalid inputs') from e

we raise ValueError to indicate that the specified values were not proper.
now the caller have to handle this exception.
It is important that this behavior is documented(check item 49 Write docstrings for every function, class and module)

here is how we use it
x, y = 5, 2
try:
    result = divide(x, y)
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid inputs")
else:
    print("Result is %.1f' % result)


Things to remember:
1. Functions that return None to indicate special meaning are error prone 
    as None, empty string and zero all evaluate to False in conditional expressions.
2. Raise exceptions instead of returning None. The caller should handle them not you!
DONT FORGET TO DOCUMENT THE BEHAVIOR SO THAT THE CALLER CAN HANDLE IT!!!
